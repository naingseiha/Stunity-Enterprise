## 🔐 Authentication & Security (Enterprise-Grade)

### Core Auth
- **Email OR phone** — Register and login with either (at least one required); single "Email or Phone" field on mobile and web
- **Organization optional** — Registration step 2; users can skip organization name
- **Session persists until logout** — No Remember me checkbox; tokens persist like Facebook
- **Login persistence hardening** — Mobile app now keeps persisted session during transient verify/refresh failures and only clears on terminal token rejection
- Email/password registration + login
- Role selection: Student, Teacher, Admin, Parent
- Claim code enrollment: `STNT-XXXX-XXXX` links users to a school
- JWT access tokens (30d) + refresh tokens (365d), bcrypt 12 rounds
- Parent portal with separate login (linked to student accounts)
- **Parent Portal mobile app** — ParentLoginScreen, ParentNavigator, ParentHomeScreen, ParentChildScreen, grades/attendance/report-card screens
- Profile setup screen (bio, avatar, interests)

### Security Foundation
- **Helmet** security headers on auth-service + feed-service
- **HPP** (HTTP Parameter Pollution) protection
- **Rate limiting** — 6 different limiters:
  - Global: 100 req/15min (auth), 100 req/min (feed)
  - Auth-specific: 10 login attempts/15min (skip successful)
  - Register: 5/hour, Password reset: 3/hour, 2FA: 5/5min
  - Feed writes: 30/min, Uploads: 20/5min
- **Brute force protection** — progressive lockout (5/10/15 failed attempts → 15min/30min/1hr lock)
- **Password policy** — 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char, common password block, password history check
- **JWT hardening** — short expiry, `passwordChangedAt` invalidation

### Password Reset Flow
- `POST /auth/forgot-password` — sends reset email (Resend in prod, console.log in dev)
- `POST /auth/reset-password` — validates crypto token, enforces password policy
- `POST /auth/change-password` — authenticated password change with history check
- **Mobile:** ForgotPasswordScreen + ResetPasswordScreen (full UI with validation)
- **Web:** `/auth/forgot-password` + `/auth/reset-password` pages with strength indicators

### OAuth2 Social Login (Backend Ready)
- **4 providers:** Google, Apple, Facebook, LinkedIn
- Unified `handleSocialLogin()` handler with automatic account linking
- Account link/unlink endpoints for managing connected social accounts
- Graceful 501 response when provider env vars not configured
- **Mobile:** OAuth-ready buttons (Google + Apple) — activate by adding env vars
- **Web:** Social login icon buttons on login page (Google, Apple, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- **Env vars needed:** `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `APPLE_SERVICE_ID`, `FACEBOOK_APP_ID`/`FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`, `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID`/`LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET`

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- **TOTP-based** (compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
- `POST /auth/2fa/setup` — generates QR code + secret
- `POST /auth/2fa/verify-setup` — enables 2FA, returns 10 backup codes
- `POST /auth/2fa/verify` — login challenge (TOTP or backup code)
- `POST /auth/2fa/disable` — disable with TOTP verification
- Backup codes: 10 one-time codes, individually bcrypt-hashed
- **Mobile:** TwoFactorScreen — 6-digit input with paste support + backup code toggle
- **Web:** Auth API functions (setup2FA, verifySetup2FA, verify2FA, disable2FA)

### Database Models (Prisma)
- `SocialAccount` — stores linked social provider accounts per user
- `TwoFactorSecret` — stores encrypted TOTP secret + hashed backup codes
- `LoginAttempt` — audit trail for login attempts (IP, user agent, success/failure)

## 📱 Social Feed (Mobile — Fully Optimized)

### Post Creation
- 7 post types: **Text, Poll, Quiz, Course, Project, Question, Exam, Announcement**
- Image upload (multiple images per post) via Cloudflare R2
- Post visibility: Public, School, Class, Followers Only
- Tag support with autocomplete

### Feed Display & Algorithm
- Personalized feed with 6-factor scoring algorithm:
  - Engagement (25%), Relevance (25%), Quality (15%), Recency (15%), Social Proof (10%), Learning Context (10%)
- **Author affinity** — 0–0.4 boost based on interaction history (likes, comments, follows)
- 3-pool mixing: 60% relevance + 25% trending + 15% explore
- Diversity enforcement across post types
- New posts always appear (two-query candidate pool: 75 trending + 25 fresh/last-6h)
- Real-time "New Posts" pill (Twitter-style) via Supabase postgres_changes; **Background/Foreground lifecycle aware**
- ETag/304 caching (saves bandwidth on unchanged feeds)
- Cursor-based pagination (no offset, scales to billions of posts)
- Feed payload reduced 76% via `stripToMinimal` field projection

### Post Cards (7 types rendered correctly)
- Text posts with inline media gallery (all images shown)
- Quiz posts with: question count, time limit, pass %, "Take Quiz" / "Retake Quiz" button
- Previous quiz attempt result shown (score %, pass/fail badge)
- Poll posts with live vote percentages + tap to vote
- Announcement posts with school badge
- Course, Project, Exam, Question posts with type-specific styling
- Multi-image carousel (all images, no blur — was a bug, now fixed)

### Interactions
- **Like / Reaction:** Optimistic UI, real-time counter via Supabase
- **Comment:** Real-time (Supabase postgres_changes), no double-display, optimistic add
- **Repost / Quote Repost:** Creates new post referencing original
- **Bookmark:** Save posts for later
- **Share:** Deep link sharing

### Notifications (Real-time)
- Bell badge updates instantly via Supabase Realtime
- Notification types: Like, Comment, Follow, Repost (SHARE), Quiz Attempt, Achievement, Grade Update, System
- SSE fallback for non-Supabase events
- **Push notifications** (Expo Push with FCM/APNs) — works when app is closed
- **School→Feed notification bridge**: grade/attendance events → student in-app notifications

### Feed Performance (Optimized for Scale)
- FlashList (RecyclerView-backed, not FlatList)
- `drawDistance=600`, `windowSize=7`, `maxToRenderPerBatch=8`
- `removeClippedSubviews={Platform.OS === 'android'}` (iOS false — prevents Core Animation jank)
- `hasPrefetched` as `useRef` (zero re-renders during scroll)
- Granular Zustand selectors (prevent full FeedScreen re-render on single state change)
- Memoized SVG performance rings (no recompute on scroll)
- 500ms throttled scroll handler

### Backend Performance (Optimized for Scale)
- All user-data queries parallelized with `Promise.all`
- Redis SCAN (not KEYS) — prevents Redis blocking at scale
- `createMany({ skipDuplicates: true })` for bulk view inserts
- No `COUNT(*)` on paginated feed (uses `hasMore` boolean)
- DB-level `COUNT/_count/aggregate` for analytics (no memory OOM on viral posts)
- Background scoring job gated via `DISABLE_BACKGROUND_JOBS=true` env var
