## 🎯 Purpose of This Archive

### Why Keep These Docs?

1. **Historical Reference**
   - Understand how features were originally implemented
   - See the evolution of the system
   - Learn from past decisions

2. **Bug Fix History**
   - Reference past bug fixes
   - Avoid repeating mistakes
   - Understand why certain solutions were chosen

3. **Feature Implementation History**
   - See how features evolved
   - Understand implementation challenges
   - Learn from successes and failures

4. **Audit & Compliance**
   - Documentation trail for audits
   - Project history for stakeholders
   - Reference for regulatory compliance

5. **Knowledge Transfer**
   - Help new team members understand history
   - Provide context for current decisions
   - Preserve institutional knowledge

---

## ⚠️ When to Use Archived Docs

### ✅ Good Reasons to Reference Archive
- Understanding why a feature works a certain way
- Investigating historical bugs
- Learning about past implementation decisions
- Researching original requirements
- Audit trail and compliance needs

### ❌ Don't Use Archive For
- Current development guidance
- Implementation instructions
- Architecture decisions
- API documentation
- Deployment procedures

**Use current documentation instead**: [`docs/future-implementation/`](../future-implementation/)
